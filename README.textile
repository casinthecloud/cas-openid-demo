h2. What is this project ?

This project *cas-openid-demo* has been created to test the OpenId support in CAS. It's composed of two modules :
- the *cas-openid-client-demo* module is the OpenId consumer : it's a web app where the user can fill its OpenId identifier to be authenticated at the OpenId provider (it's based on Spring MVC and uses the opendid4Java library)
- the *cas-openid-server-demo* module is the OpenId provider : it's a CAS server customized with OpenId support : "https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASUM/OpenID":https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASUM/OpenID.
